# California Housing Price Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes California housing prices using various machine learning models. The dataset is preprocessed, and five different regression models are implemented to predict the median house value.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **California housing dataset**. It includes various features such as median income, house age, and geographical location.

## Steps in the Project
1. **Load the Dataset**: Read the CSV file and display initial insights.
2. **Handle Missing Values**: Fill missing values with the median.
3. **Encode Categorical Variables**: Convert non-numeric data into numerical format.
4. **Split Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. **Standardize Features**: Normalize the dataset for better model performance.
6. **Train Models**: Implement the following models:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
7. **Evaluate Models**: Compare performance using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score.
8. **Results**: Display model evaluation metrics.
